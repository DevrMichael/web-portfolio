# Monorepo for Multiple Projects

This monorepo is designed to house multiple projects, providing a centralized location for development, testing, and deployment processes. It leverages the power of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for React-based projects, ensuring a streamlined setup and build process.

## Monorepo Structure

This repository is organized into subdirectories, each representing a standalone project within the broader ecosystem. This structure simplifies dependency management, code sharing, and project orchestration.

### Projects Included

- `Krist`: Clothing store login pages
- `...`

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory of interest:

```bash
    git clone [https://your-repository-url.git](https://github.com/DevrMichael/web-portfolio.git)
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed to use `npm` commands.

### Common Commands

Below are commands available across all projects within the monorepo:

#### `npm start`

Runs the selected app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload with edits, and lint errors will be shown in the console.

#### `npm test`

Initiates the test runner in interactive watch mode. More details can be found in the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) documentation.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, optimizing the build for performance. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes. Ready for deployment!

#### `npm run eject`

Ejects the build setup. **Note: this is irreversible.** It removes the single build dependency and copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) into your project for full control.

### Deployment

For deployment strategies and more detailed instructions, refer to the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).
